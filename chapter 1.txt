Installation
Open the Extensions sidebar in VS Code. View → Extensions
Search for Palenight, choose "Palenight Theme" by Olaolu Olawuyi
Click Install to install it
Navigate to File > Preferences > Color Theme > Palenight Theme (or any of the variants listed)
Psst! If you have the Operator Mono font installed, you might be interested in the Palenight Operator variant. Also, if you like some good ol' italics on certain keywords, try out the Palenight Italic variant.

There's also an Atom version of this theme created by me.

Mild Contrast
This theme uses minimal contrast across most of its variants, however, if you feel like the workbench could use a bit more, there's an experimental mild contrast variant under the name Palenight (Mild Contrast), and it looks somewhat like this:
